			"description":"According to UNCTAD’s Creative Report (2010), the Creative Economy is one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy, not only in terms of income generation, but also in terms of job creation and exports revenue. The Creative Economy has been seen as an fast alternative strategy for countries to promote their economic growth and development, especially after the success of the British experience. As a consequence, the debate about Creative Economy has improved in the public sphere, generating public policies aimed at the promotion of cultural and creative activities. Thus, the Dialogues conference will promote the debate about the local experiences in Argentina and Brazil on the public initiatives in the promotion of the creative activities and their impacts.",
